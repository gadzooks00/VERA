# VERA
***V***ersatile ***E***lectrode Localization F***ra***mework was built to simplify electrode localization in ECoG and sEEG. As more and more invasive electrophysiological techniques become available, so do algorithms to make localization as accurate and seameless as possible. Unfortunatly, a lot of these methods come with their own tool, making it difficult to compare approaches or unify data structures.

VERA was specifically built for this purpose. The framework allows other tools to be integrated into existing pipelines without changing the localization pipeline.

# Quick Guide
## Installation & Startup
VERA can be used by any MatLab distribution later than Matlab 2016b. Download the repository into an empty directory and run *startup_off.m*
